# Basic hotkeys

`i3` is one out of the many free linux window managers out there.

It's really good and easy to use out of the box in my opinion.

Although I've been using it for a long time now, I haven't made time to actually write stuff about it.

However, after experiencing times wherein I forget hotkeys for certain actions I want to do, I thought it'd be good to make a living TIL document for it.

So here it is, my little cheatsheet for `i3` commands/hotkeys I occasionally forget:

```sh
<mod> d # find a program you want to launch
<mod> <shift> q # force close a window/program
```

Note: `<mod>` here would be the default binding for me atleast, i.e. the `<super>` / `<windows>` key.
