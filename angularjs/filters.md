In Angular, we use filters to transform data on the front-end.

For this TIL, I plan to use this page as a living document for filters I come across and learn to use more often...

#### `filter`
`filter` as you would guess, enables us to get a subset of an array that satisfies a filter function/condition.

For this TIL entry, we'll do (3) examples: a simple filter-match, an object filter-match and a custom filter-match...
