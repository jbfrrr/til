# Kill Window

Let be whatever your tmux control prefix is. In my case, itâ€™s just the default, ctrl+b

To kill the current/active `window` in tmux, simply do
```
<prefix> &
```
Then you'll just be prompted/asked to confirm whether or not to push through with killing the current/active window.

`kill-window bash? (y/n): `

Hit `y` to confirm kill operation or `n` to cancel it.
