# Change session name

Let `<prefix>` be whatever your tmux control prefix is. In my case, it's jus the default, `ctrl+b`

To rename your current/active session, just do

```
<prefix> $
```

You will then see your tmux session's bottom bar light up in a different color (usually yellow).
This hints that you can now input your new session name.

Once you're happy, just hit `<enter>` and you're good to go...
