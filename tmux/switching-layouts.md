#Switching Layouts
Let `<prefix>` be whatever your tmux control prefix is. In my case, it's just the default, `ctrl+b`

To switch among available layouts with the panes you have in a window simply do:
```
<prefix> <spacebar>
```

**use case**: If you don't want to think about sequencing vertical and horizontal splits, and possibly, even avoid resizing panes afterwards, use this!
