# Ternary Operation

Unfortunately, unlike most programming languages whose ternary operation takes the form of
```php
isTest ? 'yes' : 'no';
```
python's ternary operation looks different, i.e.
```python
'yes' if test else `no`
```

The reason why python did this was because it believed the former is hard to understand esp. for programmers who do not have a background in C.

While I do agree the latter is more readable, I feel this breaks most programmers' intuition...lol
