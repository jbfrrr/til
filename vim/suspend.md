# Suspend session

Did you know there's another way to exit `vim` than your usual `:q!` or `:wq` or `:x` or the like?

Did you know you can exit `vim` and, if you wished later on, go back to the `vim` session you left a.k.a suspending vim?

Well, TIL, doing **`ctrl+z`** will suspend `vim` and return you back to your initial shell before you opened `vim`.

To get back to the `vim` session you suspended, simply type **`fg`**
