# Relocating a tab

To move/switch the active tab to the right side by `n` times just do:
```
:tabm +<n>
```

To move/switch the active tab to the left side by `n` times, just do:
```
:tabm -<n>
```

**pro tip**: To make relocating a tab more seamless, you can add the operations in your `aliases.vim` using the shortcut of your choice.
